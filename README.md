# MultiChat

MultiChat is a Python-based multi-provider chatbot that supports OpenAIâ€™s Assistants API (and is structured for future OpenRouter integration). It allows users to select from multiple LLMs, spin up assistants, save conversations, and interact via terminal.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiChat.git  
   cd MultiChat

2. Install required dependencies:

   pip install openai python-dotenv

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

   OAI=your_openai_api_key_here

## How to Run

Run the main script:

   python src/application/main.py

You will be prompted to:
- Choose a provider (e.g., openai)
- Select a model (e.g., gpt-4o)
- Name your conversation
- Start chatting

## Features

- Supports OpenAI Assistants API
- Remembers and saves your threads and messages
- Uses openai.json to map assistant IDs to model names
- Prepares for future support of OpenRouter
- CLI-based interaction
